# Soundworks ProXoMix

> *ProXoMix* is a collective performance based on the [*Soundworks*](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks/) framework.

Each *player* is represented by a sound in the audio scene. By coming closer to a given player / device, it's corresponding sound will get louder in my audio scene.

```sh
# to start the application server
npm install
npm run start
```

```sh
# to start the application on a device see app-player/README
```
